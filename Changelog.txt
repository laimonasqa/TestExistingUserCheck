0.017

-	Now the payments to be checked can be added individually to the batch so we can choose what payment have to be checked in each single batch.
-	Reports have been improved to show all the payment methods checking individually
-	Both regular CSS and Labels CSS have been implemented for these changes, so the code is working in both ways.
-	All IBN English sites batches have been updated to work in this way, now l1club3000 is working.

0.016
-	Now all the screenshots are taken when a deposit is placed showing the receipt ticket (worked in carlton Bingo and Bingozino (both stage))

-	Code are more robust now, some improvements made to it replacing try’s and removing some loops to increase stability and speed.
-	Before this update, an error screenshot was launched also if a deposit was successfully placed, this was fixed

0.015

-	Improvement in the code, a “TRY” was included in the last update and was not launching any error if an Exception occurs. This is fixed now.

0.014

-	Maven project redefined to make easiest for the code to find classes into the project
-	Added some control messages to be able to see what is happening in some steps (I ask you to leave in there for now so if anything fails would be easiest for us to find where exactly failed)
-	Added some code improvements regarding element finding, now I am not getting the running locking we got before in Slotmine.
-	Timeout has been placed at 5 seconds and everything is working right in server, so I would say to left it in 5 and launch Live 1 Job. If anything goes wrong I will raise it to 60 as always.
-	Decrease a lot the time of execution for the second iteration, now a global variable stores the Register Element Css once it is adquired in first iteration, so it is no need to find for it again in 2nd iteration.

0.013

-	Now the batch will be launched twice if anything fails, to ensure that the site is failing and is nothing about the code.
-	Timeout raised to 60.

-	Timeout is now 30 seconds, all the tests have passed or failed no matter what the timeout is, also if the timeout is 60.
